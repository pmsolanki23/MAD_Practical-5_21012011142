Ans:

An Intent is a messaging object used to request an action from another app component in Android. It is mostly used to start an activity, send a broadcast receiver, start services, and send messages between two activities1.

There are two types of Intents in Android:

Implicit Intent: Using implicit Intent, components canâ€™t be specified. An action to be performed is declared by implicit intent. Then the Android operating system will filter out components that will respond to the action. For example, opening a webpage. The user does not name a specific component but declares a general action to perform

ex:When you tap the share button in any app you can see the Gmail, Bluetooth, and other sharing app options.

Explicit Intent: Explicit Intent specifies the component. In such a case, intent provides the external class to be invoked. For example, moving from one activity to another within your app. The user has a clear vision and knows exactly which activity can handle the requests

ex:Suppose you have two activities in your application: MainActivity and SecondActivity. You want to navigate from MainActivity to SecondActivity when a button is clicked.

Types of Intent Actions:

Browser Intent: Action: Open browser for search specific things.
Call Intent: Action: Initiate a phone call to John Smith's phone number.
Call Log Intent: Action: Retrieve and display the user's call log entries for the specified time period (in this case, today).
Gallery Intent: Action: Retrieve and display photos from the user's photo gallery that are tagged or identified as being from their vacation.
Camera Intent: Action: Activate the device's camera and prompt the user to capture a picture of the sunset.
Alarm Intent: Action: Schedule an alarm to trigger at 7:30 AM the next day.
